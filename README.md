# GreenForked üå±

A scalable, modern web application for vegan food lovers, bloggers, and the plant-based community. Users can upload, browse, like, and comment on vegan recipes, with a clean, mobile-friendly interface and robust backend.

## About This Project

This is a TDD Sandbox Project created as part of the Optivem Journal TDD in Legacy Code series by Valentina Jemuoviƒá. The goal is to practice TDD and Hexagonal Architecture in a safe, simulated environment before applying these practices to real-life projects.

## Use Cases
- Register/login with Google
- Create, edit, delete vegan recipes
- Browse, search, and filter recipes
- Like and comment on recipes
- User profiles with bio, image, social links
- Admin moderation (ban, warn, delete users/recipes)
- Report inappropriate recipes and users
- Category management (recipes can be organized and filtered by category; admins can manage the list of categories)
- Nutrition analysis (calorie calculation via Nutritionix API)

## System Architecture

### Architecture Overview

GreenForked uses an event-driven microservices architecture with both synchronous and asynchronous processing. 

- **Synchronous:** User authentication, CRUD operations, and real-time interactions are handled directly by the core services (User, Recipe, Interaction).
- **Asynchronous:** Time-consuming or external operations are handled via a Redis-based message queue and background workers for improved scalability and user experience.

**Asynchronous processing is powered by:**
- **Redis Queue:** Central message broker for background jobs
- **Background Workers:**
  - **Image Processor:** Handles image resizing, optimization, and metadata extraction
  - **Nutrition Worker:** Processes nutrition analysis via Nutritionix API
  - **Search Indexer:** Updates Elasticsearch indices for recipe search
  - **Notification Worker:** Sends email and push notifications
  - **Moderation Worker:** Processes user/recipe reports and moderation tasks

This approach ensures fast user responses and scalable background processing for heavy or external tasks.

### Microservices
- **User Service**: Handles authentication (Google OAuth), user registration, profile management, and admin actions
- **Recipe Service**: Manages recipe CRUD, image uploads, search/filter, reporting, nutrition, and category management (including creating, editing, deleting, and listing recipe categories for organizing and filtering recipes)
- **Interaction Service**: Manages comments and likes on recipes

### Worker Microservices (Asynchronous Processing)
- **Image Processor**: Handles image resizing, optimization, and metadata extraction
- **Nutrition Worker**: Processes nutrition analysis via Nutritionix API
- **Search Indexer**: Updates Elasticsearch indices for recipe search
- **Notification Worker**: Handles email and push notifications
- **Moderation Worker**: Processes user/recipe reports and moderation tasks
