# GreenForked üå±

A scalable, modern web application for vegan food lovers, bloggers, and the plant-based community. Users can upload, browse, like, and comment on vegan recipes, with a clean, mobile-friendly interface and robust backend.

## About This Project

This is a TDD Sandbox Project created as part of the Optivem Journal TDD in Legacy Code series by Valentina Jemuoviƒá. The goal is to practice TDD and Hexagonal Architecture in a safe, simulated environment before applying these practices to real-life projects.
