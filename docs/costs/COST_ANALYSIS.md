## Future Scaling Options

As usage grows, you may need to scale up resources or move to managed services for reliability and ease of maintenance. Example upgrade paths:

| Service                | Plan/Usage                        | Monthly Cost (USD) |
|------------------------|-----------------------------------|--------------------|
| Linode 8GB x2          | 2 nodes, 8GB RAM each             | $96                |
| Managed PostgreSQL     | Linode Managed DB, 4GB RAM, 80GB  | $63                |
| Cloudflare Images      | Paid tier (100GB, 100k images)    | $5                 |
| Nutritionix API        | 50,000 requests/month             | $29                |
| SSL                    | Let's Encrypt                     | $0                 |
| **Total**              |                                   | **$134**           |

- Upgrade Linode resources as traffic and data grow
